# Firebase Auth

I am working through the fabulous tutorial by The Net Ninja on [Firebasee Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jUPIes_B8vRjn1_GaplOPQ). However, I am using Nuxt.Js, the Nuxt/Firebase module, and Vuetify for visual styling. I previously worked through
another playlist by The Net Ninja on using Vuetify to quickly build beautiful and reactive user interfaces which I would highly recommend.

## Things Learned

- So far I've been impressed with Firebase authentication as well as Firestore document storage. I'm primarily a SQL DB back-end kind of guy but I can quickly see how useful something like this could be.

- It pays to be careful with how often you load data. It seems like, with some careful planning, you could serve the data for a fairly busy site while remaining in the "free" tier of FireStore read/write quotas.
